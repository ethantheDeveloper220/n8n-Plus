## 5. Using Your Local Frontend Code with Docker

By default, Docker uses the built-in frontend. To use your local changes:
1. Build the frontend:
   ```sh
   cd packages/frontend
   pnpm build
   ```
2. Build a custom Docker image or mount the `dist` folder into the container (advanced).

---

## 6. Environment Variables & Configuration
- See the [n8n docs](https://docs.n8n.io/) for all available environment variables (auth, database, etc).
- You can set variables with `-e` in Docker or in a `.env` file for Node.js.

---

## 7. Updating n8n
- With Docker: `docker pull n8nio/n8n` then restart the container.
- With Node.js: `git pull` and rebuild (`pnpm build`).

---

## 8. Troubleshooting
- Check logs: `docker logs n8n` or see terminal output for Node.js.
- Make sure ports are not blocked (default: 5678).
- For more help, visit the [n8n Community Forum](https://community.n8n.io/).

---

## 9. Security Tips
- Set up authentication: [n8n docs - Security](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/security/)
- Use HTTPS in production.
- Regularly update your instance.

## What does n8n mean?

**Short answer:** It means "nodemation" and is pronounced as n-eight-n.

**Long answer:** "I get that question quite often (more often than I expected) so I decided it is probably best to answer it here. While looking for a good name for the project with a free domain I realized very quickly that all the good ones I could think of were already taken. So, in the end, I chose nodemation. 'node-' in the sense that it uses a Node-View and that it uses Node.js and '-mation' for 'automation' which is what the project is supposed to help with. However, I did not like how long the name was and I could not imagine writing something that long every time in the CLI. That is when I then ended up on 'n8n'." - **Jan Oberhauser, Founder and CEO, n8n.io**
